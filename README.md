# Winston Jr's Portfolio

## Description

In this project we created our first portfolio. This allowed to practice what we learned with HTML and CSS. This was a tough assignment because we also had to do outside research to complete the assignment. But it was a great learning experience and a good way to dive right into the web development world.
